                <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science
                Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness
                them.</p>

                <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
